A three-dimensional twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React, TypeScript, and Three.js.

ðŸŽ® **[Play the game live here!](https://ericpollmann.github.io/3d-react-tac-toe/)**

## Features

- **3D Game Board**: Play on a 3x3x3 cube with 27 positions
- **Keyboard Controls**: Use letter keys (a-z) and 0 to place pieces
- **Visual Position Guide**: Each empty cell shows its keyboard shortcut
- **Position Key**: Reference guide in the lower-left corner
- **Score Tracking**: Persistent score tracking between sessions
- **Game History**: View recent game results with move counts
- **Move Records**: Track your fastest and longest winning games
- **Global Leaderboard**: Compete with players worldwide (demo mode included)
- **Interactive 3D View**: Rotate the board with mouse/touch controls
- **Smart AI Opponent**: Play against a computer opponent

## How to Play

### Keyboard Controls

Place your piece (O) by pressing the corresponding letter key:

**Top Layer:**
```
a b c
d e f  
g h i
```

**Middle Layer:**
```
j k l
m 0 n
o p q
```

**Bottom Layer:**
```
r s t
u v w
x y z
```

The center position of the middle layer is accessed with the '0' key.

### Winning

Get three in a row in any direction:
- Horizontal (within a layer)
- Vertical (within a layer)
- Depth (across layers)
- Diagonal (within a layer or across layers)

## Global Scoreboard

The game includes a truly global scoreboard feature that allows players worldwide to:
- See the last 5 games played by anyone globally
- View records for games won with the least and most moves across all players
- Submit their own games to the shared global leaderboard
- Enter a player name to personalize their games

### Backend Storage

The global scoreboard uses **AWS Lambda + DynamoDB** for secure, serverless storage:

- **Serverless API**: AWS Lambda functions handle all database operations
- **No credentials in frontend**: Secure architecture with no AWS keys exposed
- **Automatic scaling**: Lambda and DynamoDB scale automatically with usage
- **TTL support**: Game records automatically expire after 30 days
- **Fallback support**: If API is not configured, gracefully falls back to localStorage
- **Free tier friendly**: Optimized to stay within AWS free tier limits

### Setup for Global Scoreboard

To enable the truly global scoreboard:

1. **Deploy the Lambda API** (requires AWS CLI):
   ```bash
   cd lambda
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Configure the frontend** with your API endpoint:
   ```bash
   # For local development
   echo "REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-api-url/prod" >> .env.local
   
   # For production, set in your build environment
   export REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-api-url/prod
   ```

3. **Redeploy your frontend** with the API URL configured

The Lambda deployment script automatically:
- Creates the DynamoDB table with TTL
- Sets up API Gateway with CORS
- Configures IAM roles with least privilege
- Provides you with the API endpoint URL

See `lambda/README.md` for detailed deployment instructions.

**Without API configuration**: The game works perfectly with localStorage and demo data, maintaining the same user experience.
