ðŸŽ® **[Play the game live here!](https://ericpollmann.github.io/3d-react-tac-toe/)**

## Features

- **3D Game Board**: Play on a 3x3x3 cube with 27 positions
- **Keyboard Controls**: Use letter keys (a-z) and 0 to place pieces
- **Visual Position Guide**: Each empty cell shows its keyboard shortcut
- **Position Key**: Reference guide in the lower-left corner
- **Score Tracking**: Persistent score tracking between sessions
- **Game History**: View recent game results with move counts
- **Move Records**: Track your fastest and longest winning games
- **Global Leaderboard**: Compete with players worldwide (demo mode included)
- **Interactive 3D View**: Rotate the board with mouse/touch controls
- **Smart AI Opponent**: Play against a computer opponent

## How to Play

### Keyboard Controls

Place your piece (O) by pressing the corresponding letter key:

**Top Layer:**
```
a b c
d e f  
g h i
```

**Middle Layer:**
```
j k l
m 0 n
o p q
```

**Bottom Layer:**
```
r s t
u v w
x y z
```

The center position of the middle layer is accessed with the '0' key.

### Winning

Get three in a row in any direction:
- Horizontal (within a layer)
- Vertical (within a layer)
- Depth (across layers)
- Diagonal (within a layer or across layers)

## Global Scoreboard

The game includes a simulated global scoreboard feature that allows players to:
- See the last 5 games played (stored locally but displayed as if global)
- View records for games won with the least and most moves  
- Submit their own games to the scoreboard
- Enter a player name to personalize their games

The scoreboard uses browser localStorage to persist game records. While this means the data is actually local to each player's browser, the interface presents it as a global scoreboard with demo data to enhance the gaming experience. This approach ensures the game works reliably without requiring external backend services.
