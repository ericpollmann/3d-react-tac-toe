- **Keyboard Controls**: Use letter keys (a-z) and 0 to place pieces
- **Visual Position Guide**: Each empty cell shows its keyboard shortcut
- **Position Key**: Reference guide in the lower-left corner
- **Score Tracking**: Persistent score tracking between sessions
- **Game History**: View recent game results with move counts
- **Move Records**: Track your fastest and longest winning games
- **Global Leaderboard**: Compete with players worldwide (demo mode included)
- **Interactive 3D View**: Rotate the board with mouse/touch controls
- **Smart AI Opponent**: Play against a computer opponent

## How to Play

### Keyboard Controls

Place your piece (O) by pressing the corresponding letter key:

**Top Layer:**
```
a b c
d e f  
g h i
```

**Middle Layer:**
```
j k l
m 0 n
o p q
```

**Bottom Layer:**

```

The center position of the middle layer is accessed with the '0' key.

### Winning

Get three in a row in any direction:
- Horizontal (within a layer)
- Vertical (within a layer)
- Depth (across layers)
- Diagonal (within a layer or across layers)

## Global Scoreboard

The game includes a truly global scoreboard feature that allows players worldwide to:
- See the last 5 games played by anyone globally
- View records for games won with the least and most moves across all players
- Submit their own games to the shared global leaderboard
- Enter a player name to personalize their games

### Backend Storage

The global scoreboard uses **AWS DynamoDB** for reliable, scalable storage:

- **Automatic table creation**: The app creates the DynamoDB table if it doesn't exist
- **TTL support**: Game records automatically expire after 30 days to manage storage costs
- **Fallback support**: If AWS is not configured, the app falls back to localStorage
- **Free tier friendly**: Uses on-demand billing to stay within AWS free tier limits

### Setup for Your Own AWS Instance

To use your own AWS DynamoDB instance:

1. Set up AWS credentials in your environment:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

2. The app will automatically:
   - Create a DynamoDB table named `3d-tic-tac-toe-games`
   - Set up TTL for automatic cleanup
   - Handle all game record storage and retrieval

If AWS credentials are not provided, the game gracefully falls back to localStorage while maintaining the same user experience.
